# 01. Truss Element
---
The simple code implemented for the springs element can be easily adapted to consider an assemblage of two-dimensional truss element. In fact the code can be converted into a general program to consider a variety of elements just by adding subroutines with the force-displacement (stiffness) equations for each element.
In this particular problem a typical element of axial stiffness $AE/L$ is shown its local reference system in the figure below.
